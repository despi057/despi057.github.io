        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Dulce Espinoza and I am a third year student in the school of Education. greatest ambition in life is to be an Ethnic Studies professor, specifically Chicano Studies or Mexican History. For me, this goal goes further than itÂ being just a professional goal; it has a solid foundation in my life experiences and commitment to community activism. Through education and discussion, I hope to shine light on my culture and the discrimination and challenges that my community faces. Being raised in a bilingual home, I was always surrounded by my heritage. I have a profound admiration for our cultural past because of my parents, who immigrated from Mexico. Family gatherings often consisted of storytelling sessions in which my grandparents shared their experiences and the history of their hometown. These narratives sparked my interest in not only understanding who I am, but also in learning about the historical setting of my community's obstacles and achievements. I recognized early on that stories of marginalized individuals, especially Chicanos and Mexicans, were often overlooked in mainstream education. This discovery sparked an ambition within me to ensure that these voices are not only heard, but appreciated and taught. Throughout my time as an undergraduate, I have made a commitment to immerse myself in courses that can help me better comprehend ethnic studies. I've had difficult conversations regarding identity, culture, and systematic inequality, all of which have shaped my perspective as a student and likely educator. I've also participated in a number of extracurricular activities, including as cultural clubs and student organizations focused on speaking for communities of color. These experiences strengthened my desire to create an inclusive learning environment in which students can explore their identities while understanding their roots. Volunteering with local organizations that help immigrant families was one of the most profound interactions I've had. I saw personally the difficulties that they face and the determination that they display. This occurrence not only increased the commitment I have to social justice, but it additionally showed the significance of representation in academia. As I imagine my future in academia, I see myself establishing a classroom atmosphere in which students are comfortable expressing their identities while interacting critically with what is being taught. I want to develop curricula that represent different perspectives, so that students from all backgrounds can find themselves in what they learn. This dedication comes from my idea that education should empower students, allowing them to explore their individual experiences as well as connecting with a greater cultural and historical setting. My college journey is more than simply a personal desire,Â it is an effort that will empower my community and ensure that its stories are being told and acknowledged. I want to inspire future generations to embrace their identities and advocate for social change, creating an impact that will extend far beyond the classroom. I am excited about what lies ahead and having the opportunity to make an important contribution through higher education and involvement in the community.<br>
